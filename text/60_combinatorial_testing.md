## Pairwise and Combinatorial Testing

Imagine that you're testing a word processor.  Specifically, you're testing the ability to add font effects, e.g., bold, italic, superscript, 3-D, etc.  Of course, in any word processor worth its salt, these effects can also be combined in one region of text, so that you may have a word which is both bold and italic, or a letter which is both subscripted and in 3-D, or even a sentence which is bold, italic, underlined, 3-D, and superscripted.  The number of possible combinations - ranging from absolutely no effects (and thus plain text) all the way to every single effect turned on - is 2 ^ n, where n is the number of effects.  Thus, if there are 10 different kinds of font effects available, the number of tests that you would have to run to fully test all of the possible combinations of font effects is 2 ^ 10, or 1,024.  This is a non-trivial number of tests to write.

However,
