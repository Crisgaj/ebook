### Introduction

   First off, let me say that I rarely ever read introductions to technical books, so I won't be offended if you don't read this one.

#### The story so far...

   A long time ago, in a company far, far away, I was a test lead.  One of my responsibilities was to interview potential test engineers for our team, and I found that many candidates did not have a background in testing.  People who did well often picked things up as they went, and every company did things a little differently.  It didn't help that many people who had degrees in computer science, software engineering, or a related field had never learned about software testing, or even known that it existed as a career.

   I figured that I could complain about it, or do something about it.  I was finally able to convince the Computer Science department at the University of Pittsburgh to allow me to develop and teach a class on software testing, which has become an ongoing course.  I had to develop my own curriculum, as I couldn't find a good book or syllabus on the subject that struck the right balance between theory and application.  Once again, I figured I could either complain about it, or do something about it, and once again, I chose the latter.

   Although I'm now in a more traditional software development role, I still use the concepts in this book on a daily basis.
