## Security Testing

When computers were first starting to become a thing (that's a technical term), security was not the key driver behind developing software for them.  Systems were rarely networked, so in order to tamper with the system or view its data, you would have to physically get to the computer.  Even in the 1950's, people knew how to secure physical locations (locks and security guards are pretty useful in the real world). In the rare instances that computers were networked or publicly accessible, there were few users, and they tended to be grad students, developers, or other authorized users.  Supposing somebody was able to break into a system, it was usually not a big deal.  Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, argued against having passwords in the operating system ITS, and if you wanted to crash a system running ITS, all any user had to do was type `KILL SYSTEM`.  In other words, people generally trusted each other to do the right thing.

Humanity being what it is, of course, this idyllic state of affairs was not meant to last.  Although there were few networked computers in the 1960s, there was a huge, networked system that reached a huge percentage of the population - the phone system.  People known as __phone phreaks__ would explore the phone system, figuring out how to make devices that would allow for free incoming calls or fool payphones into thinking that coins were dropped into them.  While the primary goal of most of these phone phreaks was simply understanding the labrynthine complexity of the phone system, telephone security personnel and police saw it is as an early form of "digital trespassing".

As the world became more and more networked, movies such as WarGames, which included an artificial intelligence in charge of the United States' nuclear arsenal being fooled by a teenage computer whiz; books such as _The Cuckoo's Egg_, which detailed the true story of a former astronomer tracking down a West German computer cracker; and events such as the Morris Worm, which shut down a large portion of the Internet in 1988, the concept of __information security__ was born.  Software started to include features which would prevent unauthorized access or modification to data.

Today, breaking computer security is big business, with many crackers infiltrating systems in order to blackmail companies, steal credit card information, or shut down websites which they find objectionable.
