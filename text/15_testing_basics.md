## Testing Basics

Before we get deep into actually writing tests, it behooves us to make sure that we're all on the same page with the theory and terminology of testing.  This chapter will provide us with both the same vocabulary and the same theoretical underpinnings when discussing testing.

As a caveat, I'd like to state that I have seen conflicting terminology during my career in testing.  Different workplaces and testing teams may call certain things differently, or use the same term in different ways.  I have tried to use the most common expressions, but you may see slightly different terminology in industry.
