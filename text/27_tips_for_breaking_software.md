## Breaking Sofware

Thus far, we have focused on the how 

The reason one tests is to find defects; in order to find defects, you may have to venture a bit from the happy path, where everybody enters data in the format you like, systems have infinite memory and CPU, networks have zero latency and are always connected.  You'll have to traverse through the dark woods where people try to enter "FORTY-SEVEN" instead of "47", where the program runs out memory midway through a computation, where a horror movie villain stands poised above the Ethernet cable with a sharpened axe...

Okay, maybe not that last one. However, you will have to think of ways to test for the operation of a system when things aren't quite perfect.  Consider this chapter a way of priming your testing brain for how to cause failures and find the cracks in the software under test
