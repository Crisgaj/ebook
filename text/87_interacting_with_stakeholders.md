# Interacting with Stakeholders

Through much of this book, we have spoken of testing as if in a vacuum.  You write the tests, the software either passes or fails (or you realize you wrote the test incorrectly), you file a defect report, and eventually the problem is fixed.  There is another aspect to testing that you will experience working on projects - the human element.  Managers may disagree with you on what the testing priorities are.  Developers may argue that the "defect" you found is actually expected behavior.  Fellow testers may get into shouting matches with you over subtleties in a requirements specification.

Conflict is inevitable on any team, and in fact, it's probably a positive overall.  If everybody agreed about everything all of the time, you are probably working on a pretty trivial project, and your job is likely to be replaced by a small shell script in the near future.  Resolving conflicts, although it can be difficult, is the key to succesfully preparing a product for launch.  Conflicts, as long as they are conducted professionally and productively, are often the fuel that allows a team to perform better as time goes on.

As a software tester, you will have specific challenges when interacting with other members of the development team.  After all, the whole job of a tester is to find problems with software.  They're professional critics, constantly looking for all the weak points of a system in order to make it better.  If this is not done with a gentle touch, it can often be mistaken for being a jerk.  Nobody likes to hear about the problems or shortcomings of the software they wrote, and managers don't like hearing that a product won't be ready.  As a professional fault-finder, it also becomes very easy to sink into a morass of unjustified pessimism about a product.  In this chapter, we'll discuss how to deal with these problems and successfully interact with all the people necessary to bring a project to completion.

## Who and What Are Stakeholders?

A __stakeholder__ is any person who has a direct interest in the product.  The specific kind of interest may vary based on the person and their role.  For example, the customer of a product - that is, the person who pays for it - will have a vested interest in paying as little as possible for the product.  Upper management and marketers have the exact opposite goal - they want customers to pay as much for it as possible, within epsilon of the price where people would choose a competitor.  Developers may have an interest in seeing the product written correctly, or using a language or framework that they prefer.  Quality assurance personnel may care about the quality of a product; assessors may care that the product meets all of its legal requirements; the list goes on and on.

Note that stakeholders have a _direct_ interest in the product.  In the philosophical sense, many others will have an interest in the product, or at least will be impacted by it.  For example, the owners of the coffee shop next door will hope that developers start working late and thus buying more of that sweet, sweet caffeine that comes with their coffee, thus improving their bottom line.  The spouses of the testers may want there to be fewer bugs so that the testers can spend more time with their family.  However, these are not direct interests in the product, and it could be argued that any human being is somehow impacted by the project (the Prime Minister of Luxembourg may hope to have your nation's GDP go up in order to improve their position in trade negotiations, and a successful launch of your product will help that goal!)  Although it can be a fuzzy boundary, in general if a person is not directly familiar with your product, they are in all likelihood not a stakeholder.

As mentioned above, different stakeholders will care about different aspects of the software.  Keep in mind when discussing the product with someone who is in a different stakeholder class than yourself what they are thinking about when they think about the product.  Put yourself in their shoes; does an ordinary user of your system care if the application was written in Haskell, Ruby, or Java?  Does upper management in a Fortune 500 company care about the beautiful symmetry of the icons?  Does a developer care about the latest quarterly earnings report?  Perhaps, in a few cases, or there may be some general curiousity or indirect interest.  After all, if quarterly earnings are negative too many times, there may not be a company to pay the developer's salary, or an ordinary user may also really care about type safety in the programming languages of the applications that they use.  However, in general, people spend enough time worrying about the aspects of the system that they care about that they have very little time for worrying about the rest of it.

The following a non-exhaustive list of groups of stakeholders, and a high-level view of what they are likely to care about.  Depending on the domain in which you are working, there are bound to be additional classifications, or some of these may be combined, but this should give you a general idea.

* _Customers:_ These are the people who will pay for the software.  They will focus on receiving a working system for a low price, and care about cost and the return on investment of purchasing it.
* _Users:_ These are the people who will use the software.  Note that these are sometimes the same as customers, but sometimes not - for example, when a school purchases class registration software, the school is the customer, but students are the users.  They will care about the usability of the system and if it allows them to easily accomplish their goals.
* _Project Management:_ These are the people who manage the specific project, ensuring that it is developed at an appropriate rate and released on time and on budget.  They will care about scheduling (from a resource, time, and scope perspective) and software quality.
* _Upper Management:_ Usually higher up in the management chain, to the point where they will often not be very familiar with a project itself.  They will care about the financials of the project, such as whether or not it is likely to make a profit.
* _Developers:_ The people who write the software, they will care about the tools that they use, how well the program works from a technological standpoint, and how well it solves the problem and meets the requirements.
* _Testers / Quality Assurance:_ The people who test the software and determine the quality of the system.  They will focus on finding defects on the software and care about releasing a quality product.
* _Support Personnel:_ The people who keep the software running, such as field engineers, help desk personnel, and deployment personnel.  They will care about uptime and quality of the system, and its ease of use on behalf of customers.
* _Assessors:_ These people focus on the assessing the legality of a system, ensuring that it meets all the demands made of it by laws for the domain in which it is operating.  They will care about meeting the legal or other documented requirements.

This is only a rough guide to some of the kinds of stakeholders you will interact with as a software tester.  Remember that these are drawn with very broad strokes!  People are individuals, not faceless members of groups, no matter what your friend who has read too much philosophy has to say.  Although you can use this information to get a general idea of what individual stakeholders are interested in, nothing will take the place of having real interactions, and more importantly, _asking_ what is important to them.

## Reporting and Communicating

When communicating with a stakeholder who has a different focus from you, you should take care to understand the language of that person and what they care about, and you should care enough to talk about the things they care about in their language.  Try to put yourself in their shoes before talking to them - first, ask yourself if they care about what you want to talk with them about.  If not, try to think if there is any deeper reason you want to discuss it with them.  In some cases, it is still essential - your manager may not care about a harassment claim, but it's still your duty to report it.  In other cases, though, it won't be necessary, and for someone who has quite a bit on their plate (as most workers do today), it's taking away valuable time that could be used for doing other things.  Second, if they do care about the topic, try to put it in terms that they understand and can conceptualize.  Don't view a conversation as a way to prove your intellect.  Use it as a way to provide valuable information in a form that the other person can use.

One of the key chasms in communication is between technical and non-technical personnel.  If you're reading this book, and I tell you that since you've got a O(n^2) sorting algorithm, you're going to see an exponential increase in RAM usage with larger data sets, you're going to have a pretty good idea of what I mean.  You may even know how to fix it (by quickly searching for "efficient sorting algorithms", of course).  However, this sentence is basically Greek to non-technical personnel (except for fluent speakers Greek, for whom it is some other language that they don't know).  However, this is the way developers, testers, and other technical personnel talk, because it's how you end up thinking when you deal with it all day, every day.  Remember, though, that other people may spend the majority of their day dealing with accounting, or sales, or marketing, or a million other things, and simply do not have the same frame of reference as you do when it comes to the system you are working on.

If you are communicating with those who are not technical or do not have the domain knowledge of the software under test, remember to explain things as a consequence they care about.  Upper management does not directly care about which sorting algorithm the program uses, but they do care if it means that only small businesses will be able to use the software because it does not handle the data sets of larger businesses.  This has a direct impact that they can understand.  When you are discussing a defect with a developer, you can be more technical and explain the situation in more detail.

When you're in school, the teachers tend to have more knowledge than you on whatever topic you're learning.  That's why they are teachers.  In the real world, though, your managers will often have much less knowledge than you on the specific system or part of the system you are working on.  This can be a shock - isn't the whole point of having bosses to have someone who understands something better than their subordinates?

Not at all.  The point of a manager is to manage.  This means more time spent on estimating, more time dealing with personnel issues, more time dealing with budget issues, etc.  This leaves precious little time for writing code or sometimes even interacting with the system at all.  Even if the manager does remain technical, they are now overseeing a larger part of the system, or even the entire system, and thus will not be able to keep as many specifics as you have on the particular part of the system you're working on.  Imagine someone working at the Department of Motor Vehicles, who focuses on renewing driver's licenses - let's call them Redli.  Redli is going to have driver's license renewals down cold.  A person transferring from out-of-state?  Someone has the wrong form of identification?  A new driver who has an old license which was suspended, but a governor's pardon has lifted the felony from their record, thus allowing them to drive again?  Redli knows all of the regulations and laws around all of them, knows exactly how to enter them into the system, and does it quickly and efficiently.

Now let's imagine Guvvy, the governor who gave out that pardon.  Guvvy is, technically speaking, Redli's boss (more like a great-great-great-great-great-grand-boss).  If you out Guvvy in Redli's place tomorrow, all hell will break loose.  Being the executive in charge of the entire state, Guvvy had to have a high-level knowledge of not only the Department of Motor Vehicles, but also environmental regulations, business conditions, the budget of the government, and lots of other things besides.  There is no way Guvvy is going to know the speifics of driver's license renewal and how to take somebody's picture, thus leading to a long line of angry motorists at the local DMV office.

This example was extended _ad absurdum_, but the point remains.  As an individual contributor, you will be focusing on a very small part of a larger project, but you will often have very detailed knowledge of it.  Managers will have a broader view of a project or projects, but will have less knowledge on the specifics of it.  The further up the chain you go, the more this is true; your immediate supervisor will have a good idea of what you do on a day-to-day basis, but the CEO of the company may not even know you - or your project - exists.

If Redli has a chance to talk to Guvvy about some problems with the driver's license renewal process, a bad idea would be to start with technical details of regulation 437-A, subsection 4, paragraph C, and its definition of "resident".  Redli should talk about it in terms that Guvvy understands - things that annoy voters and would make them more likely to vote for AntiGuvvy (who is, of course, the opponent in the upcoming gubernatorial election).  Guvvy is going to be more receptive to knowing that the law doesn't handle people who own houses in two different states than going into detail about the legalese.  This is impactful for politicians because annoyed voters are less likely to vote the incumbent (note to political science majors - I am dramatically oversimplifying to make a point, so please do not send me angry letters about gubernatorial election theory).

Similarly, when discussing the system or problems that you are having with your boss, put it into terms that they can understand.  Remember that they often have a broader view of the system that you do, and things that you consider very important may not be as important to them.  Conversely, they may not be aware of problems that you consider obvious.  Providing an open flow of information can be very helpful in both directions, allowing you as a tester to understand the system more holistically and allowing you to channel your energy and time appropriately, and allowing your supervisors knowledge of the nitty-gritty of the data, defects, and concerns you are finding in your testing as well as concerns.

## The Red-Yellow-Green Template

## Status Reports

In some positions, a daily status report is common.  I found these very useful when dealing with a geographically distributed team, especially if there is little communication during the day (for example, because parts of the team are in different time zones).  Although many agile development shops will have daily stands-ups or similar meetings to discuss status, I have always found a quick email at the end of the day will allow managers to understand what all of their employees are doing.  Additionally, it allows managers to know if there are any problems or if the team members are not spending their time appropriately.

### Example

_DAILY STATUS 7 AUG 2015

* Finished running Test Plan "Database Subsystem Regression" - recorded as Test Run 471, no new defects
* Wrote script to convert old tab-delimited test data to new comma-delimited format - available in /scripts directory on server
* Started writing Test Plan "Graphical Symbology Display" - need to get latest version of symbology standard_

These should not take very long to write; a few sentences should suffice, and I think bullet points allow for a good overall summary instead of worrying about proper grammar and developing a narrative.  This simple email allows the manager to know what the tester is working on (writing a new test plan), what additional resources are available (a script for reformatting data, which may be hepful for other team members), and where the tester may need additional resources (the latest version of the symbology standard).

Armed with this information, a manager can ask the team members to refocus efforts, or report up their own manager that there are problems.  They may be able to help with any problems that the tester is experiencing; perhaps they have a copy of the symbology standard the tester can borrow.  Finally, the team can be run more effectively when knowledge is shared in such a manner.  If the entire team can run the script that the tester has developed, they may save hours of time that would have been spent updating the test data files manually.

## Managing Expectations and Managing Up

As a new member of the team, often there is an urge one of the 

## A Note On Meetings

Very few people really enjoy meetings, outside of those who are probably busy taking courses in business school instead of reading about software testing.  However, they are often essential to determining the best path forward, and ensuring that the input of all relevant stakeholders is heard.  They often can actually be the most efficient way to get consensus on an issue, as well.

This does not mean that your presence is required at all meetings.  If you find yourself not getting any useful information, or not giving out much information - or at least not enough to justify the time you spend on it - you should consider not going to that meeting any more.  Although it may seem presumptuous to say that you don't think that you belong in a meeting, remember that any time you spend in a meeting is time that you are not spending doing something else.  A good manager will thank you for bringing it to their attention, because it means that you are thinking of your job strategically, and not just doing what is asked of you.

## Clarifying Requirements



## On Disagreeing

## Respect

You may have noticed that this subject is full of caveats.  There's a reason aside from the author not being a genius.  Dealing with people is hard and full of ambiguity.  In comparison, dealing with software can be a walk in the park.  Part of being a professional is learning to deal with these difficulties and ambiguities with grace and aplomb, and it's very difficult to put together step by step instructions or a template for that.

All of that being said, much of this chapter can be summarized by the phrase, "be respectful".  Remember that other stakeholders are going to care about different aspects of the system, or they may have a different view of the best path forward.  They may not understand everything that you do, and you may not understand anything that they do.  They may not have the same technical background or domain knowledge as you, leading to different views of what seems to be the same data.

It takes more than one kind of stakeholder to see a program to completion, and there are bound to be disagreements.  You are unlikely to change anybody's mind by treating them disrespectfully or condescendingly, and small bits of bad interaction may poison the entire well.  Keep in mind that you are looking at the problem from a very specific point of view, and you don't always have all of the answers.  If you treat people respectfully and listen dispassionately to what stakeholders have to say, you may even change your mind.  Even if you don't, ensuring peaceful dialogue amongst team members - especially with those with whom you disagree - will go a long way towards succesfully releasing a software product.
