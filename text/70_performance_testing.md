## Performance Testing

What, exactly, is performance testing?  Before we can define "performance testing", we first need to define "performance".  I assume that at this point in the book, everybody understands what "testing" means.

Most technically savvy people will have a gut feeling for what performance means - systems that are fast, don't take up muh memory, etc.  The more you try to define it, though, the more slippery the definition becomes.  More fast, compared to what?  What if a system uses lots of RAM, and a competing system uses less RAM but more hard drive space?  If System A returns an answer in three seconds, and System B returns an answer in five seconds, which is more performant?  An easy question to answer, unless the questions that they are answering are themselves different.  Performance is one of those concepts that is hard to pin down, because it will mean different things for different systems.  

Imagine a video game where you play a software tester fighting evil Bugs.  You can use the arrow keys to move and the space key to shoot your insecticide gun.  Whenever you press the space key, you will expect your avatar on-screen to shoot the insecticide within, say, 200 milliseconds - anything more and you'll feel like the video game is "lagging" behind your keypresses.  Now imagine a second system, a weather forecasting supercomputing cluster, with the ability to run millions of calculations in parallel.  However, as weather forecasting requires a large number of calculations, it takes half an hour after hitting the "run" command for the system to return what the weather forecast is for tomorrow.  Until that time, the screen just says "Calculating..."  The supercomputer has several orders of magnitude longer response time than the video game, but does this mean the supercomputer is less performant than your video game console?  On the particular __performance indicator__ of response time, one could argue yes, but that performance indicator was not considered very important to the developers of the weather forecasting system.
