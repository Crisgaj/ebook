## Acceptance and Smoke Testing

### Smoke Testing

My father is a plumber.  Before connecting the pipes in a new building to the water main, he sends smoke through the pipes, and looks around to see if any smoke has escaped from the pipes into the building.  Why does he do this?  Well, if there are any leaks, it's much easier to clean up smoke (since you just let it dissipate) than water.  It's much more noticeable if smoke is filling up a room, compared to checking if there is any wetness behind the walls.  It's much faster than inspecting all of the piping inch by inch, yet provides similar information.  Once the smoke test has been passed, the water can come in and further, more specific testing - e.g., ensuring the correct pressure at different floors - can commence.

Smoke testing in software is similar.  A __smoke test__ involves a minimal amount of testing that can be done to ensure that the system under test is ready for further testing.  It can be thought of a guard to further testing - unless the system can perform some minimal operations

Why bother performing a smoke test before a full test?  Wouldn't you eventually find all the same problems without it?
