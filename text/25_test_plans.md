## Test Plans

Now that you understand requirements, and the basic theory and terminology of software testing, it's time to work on making __test plans__.  Test plans lay out an entire plan for testing a system under test.  They are then executed - that is, a person or automated testing tool goes through the steps listed in the test plan - and the results are compared to what actually happened.  That is, we will be checking the expected behavior of a system (what we write down in our test plan) against the observed behavior (what we see the system actually doing).

#### The Basic Layout of a Test Plan

A test plan is, at is core, simply a collection of __test cases__.  Test cases are the individual tests that make up a test plan.  Let's assume that you are creating a test plan for testing a new app that tells you if a cup of coffee is too hot to drink.  Assuming that the app marketers liked cold coffee and decided not to implement anything about the coffee temperature being too low, there are two requirements:

FUN-COFFEE-TOO-HOT. If the coffee temperature is measured at 175 degrees or higher, the app shall display the "TOO HOT" message.

FUN-COFFEE-JUST-RIGHT. If the coffee temperature is measured at less than 175 degrees, the app shall display the "JUST RIGHT" message.

How would we develop a test plan for our coffee temperature app?
